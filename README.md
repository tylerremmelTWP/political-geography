# Dave Weigel's political geography from The Trailer

Code blocks required for use in Dave Weigel political geography V3s.

Intended to be used with `-d0` tag appended to end of slug so cross-fade state maps run atop headline.

Inline graphics need to be uploaded with option No. 9 (`GRAPHIC: Graphics team`), but any graphics for the topper need to be uploaded as photos so they are assigned a resizer link (No. 9 upload option graphics won't get a resizer link).

- `cross-fade-topper`: Creates cross-fade topper from multiple AF images via resizer URLs. Also includes css to limit headline width to match the copy width.

- `inline-graphic-styles`: Adjusts space on top and bottom of inline graphics.

- `include-with-all-stories`: Pulled from main V3 snippets page.

- `inline-ad`: Pulled from main V3 snippets page.
